        <p class="w3-justify w3-col m7 w3-right w3-padding ">My name is Tran Thi Thuy Tien, and my student ID is 3825458. Presently, I am majoring in Human Resources Management (HRM) at RMIT university. I am an extrovert that really enjoys making new friends, therefore, I joined many clubs, such as RMIT Human Development Club which enables me to develop interpersonal skills and meet friends who share mutual interests. My enjoyment for IT started when I attended an online event that focused on how IT will affect HRM in the future. That’s when I realized the importance of technical skill and data analysis if I want to succeed with my future career path. Moreover, our team’s name is related to two of my interests right now: business and IT - with a desire to create and support other businesses with IT solutions in the future.

        <p class="w3-justify w3-col m7 w3-left w3-padding">My name is Pham Minh Chau and my student number is s3757313. I am a 21-year old girl who wants to pursue a career as a marketer. Therefore, RMIT is my destination as its Digital Marketing degree integrates both academic and hands-on practice excellently. Another reason I study Digital Marketing is because I always have a soft spot for technology, which explains why I chose a major which combines both marketing and technology. I consider myself as a creative yet logical person as well as a quick and diligent learner who is not afraid to embrace changes. Besides studying, I also applied for several jobs to nurture skills and knowledge. One of my proudest jobs is working as an intern for a famous Digital & Creative Marketing agency, in which I had the opportunity to collaborate with co-workers to use digital platforms and technology to support marketing strategies such as design, develop and code website, produce and render video, etc. The 6-month internship has fueled my motivation to explore more about the IT world, as I acknowledge marketing without technology will fail to impress the consumers and influence their buying behaviour. By enrolling in this course, I hope to broaden my knowledge about IT knowledge and its application in our daily lives.</p>

        <p class="w3-justify w3-col m7 w3-right w3-padding ">My name is Nguyen Le Khanh Nguyen and my student number is s3759534). Currently, I am a final year student in RMIT with a major in Logistics & Supply chain management. I define myself as an outgoing and energetic person; besides, I am an progesstive person This could be illustrated clearly through my participation in two student clubs which are AIESEC and RMIT Business Club when I am a first-year student. Talking about my IT preference, I am super interested in neural networks and artificial intelligence (AI) in the IT industry. This interest originated from a “Business IT” course in RMIT in which I was given an assignment to research deeply about the application of demand planning in a furniture enterprise. Therefore, that assignment actually triggered my interest in how demand forecasting and demand sensing are applied in many industries in daily life. Since I still do not have any IT experience, I am trying my best to absorb more IT knowledge through the provision of IT-related courses on LinkedIn library or Cousera before having a chance to step into the IT working industry.

Currently, I am a junior at RMIT with a bachelor's School in Business and Management. I enrolled at the end of 2019 since the environment at RMIT is international. My sID  is s3818514. With that ID, every student can access every facility in RMIT. Since the second semester of 2021 ended, I started exploring and designing my career path during semester break. During the first week of semester break, I intentionally watched the video of Tinh Te’s workshop discussing the Data Analytics career path. Although I have not approached Information Technology before, I find it interesting, especially the Data aspect. Therefore, I am preparing to become a Business Analyst.

Being both a Logician with Thinker creativity, I am passionate about the analysing and brainstorming process, from which I could come up with innovative ideas with justification and rationale for the project idea part. With good critical-thinking ability and a high sense of commitment, I believe I can give the ideal solutions to many problems, and ensure everyone’s work will meet the highest standard. Besides, I am also a good listener thanks to the Learning test result. Thus, I could utilize this ability to foster the bonding and harmony among team members, avoiding unnecessary conflicts by listening respectfully to their ideas, making them feel heard and respected. With these aforementioned strengths and the collaboration with teammates who have different personalities like Nguyen, I hope to bring out the dynamism, equal contribution and respect to achieve the ultimate goal.

        <p class=" w3-justify">Overall, these tests somehow express how I communicate and work with others in this stage of my life. I believe these tests will not influence my behavior on a team. I'm an Introvert and Extrovert person. It implies that between working with a team as in surface, I also spend time reflecting on my work, which I believe will help a lot in the group. Otherwise, I'm a Tactile learner who's willing to dive into the project more than just discussing a subject. Especially in IT, consulting and ready theory to find a solution are just not enough. Digging while doing something is the best way to find the error and directly fix it. Therefore, it could be a positive trait for me to work in a team. Finally, the openness score shows me as a person that thinks in a sophisticated and complex idea. However, I think it could be a good point in teamwork. With a broad way of thinking, I can gather all of the necessary information for the work.
